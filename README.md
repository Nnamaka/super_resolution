</p>

- open the notebook `Super_Resolution.ipynb` and click [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nnamaka/super_resolution/blob/main/Super_Resolution.ipynb) 
- on the navigation bar, click on `Runtime`, then click `change Runtime Type`. choose `GPU`.
- Run all the cells orderly from top to bottom.
- At the upload section of the notebook, you'll need to upload an image you desire to upscale its resolution.
- The last cell downloads the upscaled image to your local directory( the downloaded image can be found in the default/designated download folder of your browser).



# Note

- The GPU runtime in colab has to be turned on
- The difference in pixel quality is observed if the uploaded image is of a considerably low resolution. say `360x540`
